This repo is a mess.

Don't look here for inspiration.

This is me purely attempting to figure this out in a space where most of this work has been abstracted away via complex modules in a different language.

But if you want to look at something actually function:
  - ./simple: Does have a function... something. It really doesn't do much.
  - ./neural-network: WORKS! This lil' guy right here is a functional, basic neural network. Currently able to accurately predict an `AND` gate
